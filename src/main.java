        // need minigames instead of choices. make it more 'game' less visual novel. maybe something that uses 50/50, and you help one side. good or bad. encompassing the scenario more.


       // maybe a shooter? two gunships fight(representing the child's choice), and you must pick which side to be on. with one side progressively getting stronger as you fight it, and the one you pick getting weaker.


        // age 5 : something silly. say the child wants cake. but its like noon and they already had cake. depending on minigame the outcome happens.
                    // the big fight wont matter at this point
                 // good?                                                                bad?
                // if denied, child may not like you, but grow to be more respectful. if allowed, child may like you, but grow spoiled or worse.



        // age 8 : in school, the kids made fun of your child's abilities. either in a bullying way or a praising way depending on the super(s). out of your control.
        //BUT, you can chose to tell your kid something now.  minigame ensues. who won? even if one side one, what did you pick? good or bad?
        //
                   // if you didnt pick a side:
                  // if you ignore the bullying, the child may grow to hate people.
                 // if you ignore the praising, the child may grow to like people.

                   // if you picked good, but bad won the minigame:
                  // if you praise with praising, the child may become narcissistic and think they can do ANYTHING(see Bakugo),

                  // if you picked good and good won too:
                 // you taught the child not to get overconfident, but to be proud of themselves. the child glows with excitement for their own future.

                 //if you picked bad and bad won too:
                // you bully the child as well(why?!) with bullying at home and school, the child will hate you and people and grow dark.

                  // if you picked bad and good won:
                 // you bully the child, with praising at school , the child may hate you and trust others more than you in the future. might even come back to take vengeance on their shitty childhood.


        // age 10 : depending on how your kid was treated two years ago, they have developed more. showing promise with their abilities and using them for everyday things. like. everything.
        // how do you feel about this? is it lazy to rely on their abilities so often, or is it good to embrace who they are? should they tone it back a little? 'but why?!'
